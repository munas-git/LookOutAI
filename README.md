# Project Title: LookOutAI

## Project Description.   
LookOutAI is a tool literally for "looking out" lol. It takes an image of someone and looks for that person in another image or video clip, describes the person's outfit and potentially what the person is doing. You can also censor a target face or have only a target face uncensored, this is useful for security purposes where vido clips have to be processed with speed and high accuracy in order to provided as evidence by police or security departmentor without disclosure of the faces of other non individuals. You can also (for fun) replace a targets face with an emoji (ðŸ¤ª, ðŸ˜ˆ, ðŸ¤¡, ðŸ™„) or have only a targets face uncensored.... For example, getting rid of your ex's face in any image with other friends lol.
